# src

## Purpose
Application source root. Uses a **colocation-based architecture**: routes live under `app/` (each feature owns its pages, layouts, and a local `_components/` folder), while cross-cutting concerns (shared UI, hooks, config, state, styles, mock data) live in dedicated top-level folders here.

## Key Files
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `proxy.disabled.ts` | Disabled Next.js proxy/middleware stub. Rename to `proxy.ts` (or `middleware.ts`) to enable request interception. There is **no active middleware** in this template |

## Subdirectories
| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `app/` | Next.js App Router routes, layouts, and route-local components (see `app/AGENTS.md`) |
| `components/` | Shared, app-wide components incl. the shadcn/ui primitive library (see `components/AGENTS.md`) |
| `config/` | App-level configuration constants (see `config/AGENTS.md`) |
| `lib/` | Utilities, fonts registry, and the preferences (theme/layout) engine (see `lib/AGENTS.md`) |
| `hooks/` | Reusable React hooks (see `hooks/AGENTS.md`) |
| `data/` | Static/mock data sources (see `data/AGENTS.md`) |
| `stores/` | Zustand client state stores and providers (see `stores/AGENTS.md`) |
| `navigation/` | Sidebar navigation definition (see `navigation/AGENTS.md`) |
| `server/` | Next.js Server Actions (see `server/AGENTS.md`) |
| `scripts/` | Build-time scripts (theme preset generation) (see `scripts/AGENTS.md`) |
| `styles/` | Global theme presets and flag-icon CSS (see `styles/AGENTS.md`) |

## For AI Agents

### Working In This Directory
- Import using the `@/` alias (e.g. `@/lib/utils`, `@/components/ui/button`), which maps to `src/`.
- Place a component in a route's `_components/` only if it is used by that route alone; promote to `src/components/` when shared.
- Keep generated shadcn/ui primitives in `components/ui/` — install new ones via the shadcn CLI rather than hand-writing.

### Testing Requirements
- No unit tests. Verify with `npm run check` and `npm run build` from the repo root.

### Common Patterns
- Client components opt in with `"use client"`; default to Server Components.
- Theme/layout preferences flow through `lib/preferences/` + `stores/preferences/` and are persisted in cookies/localStorage.
